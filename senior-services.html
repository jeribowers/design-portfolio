          <h3>Project at a Glance</h3>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> A single administrator was manually managing employee training using spreadsheets and manual follow-ups, leading to high administrative overhead and risks of missed requirements.</p>
          <p><strong>The Action:</strong> I acted as the solo product lead, designer, and orchestrator to build a custom, automated portal. Using an AI-assisted "vibe coding" workflow, I moved from a Product Requirements Document (PRD) to a fully functional, integrated system.</p>
          <p><strong>The Result (Estimated):</strong> A 70-80% reduction in administrative time and 100% audit accuracy through automated tracking and notifications.</p>

          <h2>The Context</h2>
          <p>Senior Services of South Sound is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of seniors through essential services and community connection.</p>

          <h3>The Challenge: Automating a Manual Training Workflow</h3>
          <p>I focused on solving a specific operational bottleneck: employee education and compliance. Previously, the organization relied on a manual process where one person tracked progress, managed files, and followed up with staff. I transformed this into a centralized system that removes the need for manual tracking, allowing the administrator to work on more impactful projects while ensuring all staff stay up to date.</p>

        <div class="eight offset-by-two columns">
          <h3>The Role: Solo Product Orchestrator</h3>
          <p>Transitioning from large-scale tech teams to a solo environment for this project required a fundamental shift in my approach. Without a dedicated squad of engineers or product managers, I took full ownership of the lifecycle — from gathering high-level requirements with the Deputy Executive Director to building the blueprints for how the whole system works.</p>
          <p>I delivered a dual-sided platform designed to handle the high-stakes needs of compliance while remaining simple for the end-user.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Employee Portal:</strong> A streamlined view for staff to access required trainings, track due dates, and complete quizzes.</li>
            <li><strong>Admin Dashboard:</strong> A direct management interface to oversee the employee roster, assign content, and review real-time progress.</li>

          <h2>The Strategy</h2>
          <h3>Evolution of a New Workflow: "Vibe Coding"</h3>
          <p>While I typically collaborate with engineers to bring a vision to life, this project required me to bridge that gap myself. By treating AI as a high-level technical partner, I moved beyond static designs to engineer a fully functional tool from the ground up.</p>
          <h4>3 Stages of Growth</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Learning the Patterns:</strong> Initially, I used broad prompts that resulted in inefficient, fragile code that didn't meet my quality standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Guiding the Strategy:</strong> I shifted to a deep dialogue, using Gemini as a logic partner to vet plans in plain English before providing surgical instructions to the building tool.</li>
            <li><strong>Driving the Execution:</strong> I developed a comprehensive System Guide that acted as a set of rules for privacy, accessibility, and engineering best practices. As I became more comfortable with the code, I moved from prompting to performing direct edits myself, allowing for much finer control over the final product.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="eight offset-by-two columns">
          <h3>Building a People-First Solution</h3>
          <p>I built this tool from the ground up to streamline administrative workflows and ensure the system was simple and reliable for everyday use. By handling the complex technical and compliance details in the background, I created a smooth experience that reduces the manual burden on admins while letting employees complete their tasks without friction.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Compliance Guardrails:</strong> I built technical "locks" including presentation timers, interactive quizzes, and locked acknowledgments supported by automatic tracking to ensure users meet regulatory standards by default.</li>
            <li><strong>Inclusive & Clear Design:</strong> I engineered a high-accessibility interface using WCAG standards, generous target sizes, and supportive micro-copy to reduce friction and ensure staff can complete requirements quickly and get back to their day.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliable & Secure Systems:</strong> I chose professional services like Google Auth and Resend to create a secure, robust, and automated platform that remains stable without a dedicated tech team.</li>

          <h2>The Impact</h2>
          <h3>Estimated Success Metrics</h3>
          <p>Based on the previous manual workload of around 8 hours a month:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>70-80% Time Savings:</strong> Calculated by the shift to a system where tracking and notifications happen automatically without human intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>100% Audit Accuracy:</strong> The system eliminates human error in data entry, ensuring every completion is accurately timestamped and recorded.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero-Cost Sustainability:</strong> By leveraging professional-grade free tiers, the portal costs the non-profit $0/month to run.</li>

          <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
          <p>This was my first experience with "Vibe Coding," and I’m honestly blown away by how quickly I could turn a vision into a fully functional tool. It was incredibly satisfying to take full ownership of the build, and I’m excited to keep using this workflow to bring more ideas to life.</p>
          <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Collaborative Workflow:</strong> I learned to communicate with the AI as a logic partner rather than just a task-runner. By moving beyond basic prompts and establishing clear standards, I could vet complex plans and maintain high quality throughout the build.</li>
            <li><strong>New Perspective on Engineering:</strong> I became much more familiar with how engineers structure data and best practices for building scalable software, which has improved how I communicate with technical teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Art of Balance:</strong> I learned to balance feature requests against time, costs, and complexity, ensuring the tool remains easy for the non-profit to manage in the future.</li>

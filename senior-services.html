          <h3>Project at a Glance</h3>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> A single administrator was manually managing employee training using spreadsheets and manual follow-ups, leading to high administrative overhead and risks of missed requirements.</p>
          <p><strong>The Action:</strong> I acted as the solo product lead, designer, and orchestrator to build a custom, automated portal. Using an AI-assisted "vibe coding" workflow, I moved from a Product Requirements Document (PRD) to a fully functional, integrated system.</p>
          <p><strong>The Result (Estimated):</strong> A 70-80% reduction in administrative time and 100% audit accuracy through automated tracking and notifications.</p>

          <h2>The Context</h2>
          <p>Senior Services of South Sound is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of seniors through essential services and community connection.</p>

          <h3>The Challenge: Automating a Manual Training Workflow</h3>
          <p>I focused on solving a specific operational bottleneck: employee education and compliance. Previously, the organization relied on a manual lifecycle where one person tracked progress, managed files, and followed up with staff. I transformed this into a centralized system that removes the need for manual tracking, allowing the administrator to work on more impactful projects while ensuring all staff stay up to date.</p>

          <h3>The Role: Solo Product Orchestrator</h3>
          <p>This project was a significant departure from my typical work within large tech teams. Without a dedicated squad of engineers or product managers, I was responsible for the entire lifecycle — from gathering requirements with the Deputy Executive Director to defining the data logic and integrating third-party services.</p>
          <p>I delivered a dual-sided platform designed to handle the high-stakes needs of compliance while remaining simple for the end-user.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Employee Portal:</strong> A streamlined view for staff to access required trainings, track due dates, and complete quizzes.</li>
            <li><strong>Admin Dashboard:</strong> A direct management interface to oversee the employee roster, assign content, and review real-time progress.</li>

          <h2>The Strategy</h2>
          <h3>Evolution of a New Workflow: "Vibe Coding"</h3>
          <p>Typically, I collaborate with an engineering team to bring designs to life. For this project, I learned how to bridge that gap myself using AI as a high-level collaborator. My process evolved in three stages:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Beginner Phase:</strong> Initially, I used broad prompts expecting the AI to fill in the gaps. This was inefficient and resulted in fragile code that didn't follow the quality standards I wanted.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversational Logic Phase:</strong> I shifted to a deep, back-and-forth dialogue with the AI. I used Gemini as a logic partner to vet my plans in plain English first, which allowed me to provide much more surgical instructions to the building tool.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Implementation Phase:</strong> I developed a comprehensive System Guide that acted as a set of rules for privacy, accessibility, and engineering best practices. As I became more comfortable with the code, I moved from prompting to performing direct edits myself, allowing for much finer control over the final product.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Designing for a People-First Organization</h3>
          <p>The employees are often less tech-savvy, so the experience needed to feel like a helpful assistant rather than a hurdle.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Conversational Compliance:</strong> I focused heavily on supportive micro-copy, replacing robotic alerts with friendly language.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Guardrails:</strong> I built-in specific cues like presentation timers and locked "Acknowledgment" sections that guide users through their requirements naturally.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Driving Efficiency through Integrated Services</h3>
          <p>To make the system "unbreakable" for an organization without a dev team, I integrated professional services to handle the heavy lifting:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Automated Communication:</strong> I integrated Resend to automatically email employees when a training is assigned, removing the manual follow-up burden.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure, One-Click Access:</strong> I implemented Google Auth to restrict access to company emails, providing a secure and familiar login experience for all staff.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Impact</h2>
          <h3>Estimated Success Metrics</h3>
          <p>Based on the previous manual workload of 15–20 hours a month:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>70-80% Time Savings:</strong> Calculated by the shift to a system where tracking and notifications happen automatically without human intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>100% Audit Accuracy:</strong> The system eliminates human error in data entry, ensuring every completion is accurately timestamped and recorded.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero-Cost Sustainability:</strong> By leveraging professional-grade free tiers, the portal costs the non-profit $0/month to run.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mastering Vibe Coding:</strong> As my first project using this workflow, I learned how to move from vision to a live product by treating AI as a "junior dev" that needs clear, system-level guidance.</li>
            <li><strong>New Perspective on Engineering:</strong> I became much more familiar with how engineers structure data and best practices for building scalable software, which has improved how I communicate with technical teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Art of Balance:</strong> I learned to balance feature requests against time, costs, and complexity, ensuring the tool remains easy for the non-profit to manage in the future.</li>

          <h3>Project at a Glance</h3>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> A single administrator was manually managing employee training using spreadsheets and manual follow-ups. This created a significant operational bottleneck, resulting in 12 full workdays of "busy work" annually and a $20,000+ liability risk due to potential gaps in compliance auditing.</p>
          <p><strong>The Action:</strong> I acted as the solo product lead, designer, and orchestrator to build a custom, automated compliance portal. Using an AI-assisted "vibe coding" workflow, I moved from high-level requirements to a production-ready system that features automated compliance guardrails and a zero-maintenance architecture.</p>
          <p><strong>The Result (Estimated):</strong> With the system in the final stages before launch, we anticipate a 70-80% reduction in administrative time and 100% audit accuracy through automated tracking. Additionally, the custom build bypassed $2,400 in annual software fees, providing a sustainable, professional tool at $0/month.</p>

          <h2>The Context</h2>
          <p>Senior Services of South Sound is a non-profit dedicated to improving the lives of seniors through essential services and community connection. Because they operate with a lean staff and no dedicated tech team, their internal processes had to be extremely efficient to keep up with strict state regulations.</p>

          <h3>The Challenge: Automating a Manual Training Workflow</h3>
          <p>I focused on a specific bottleneck: the manual tracking of employee education and compliance. The existing process relied on one person to manage files, update spreadsheets, and manually chase staff for completion records.</p>      
          <ul>
            <li><strong>High-Risk Liability:</strong> Without a single "source of truth," the organization risked $20k+ in fines if their records were found incomplete during a state audit.</li>
            <li><strong>Wasted Capacity:</strong> The HR Director was spending roughly 8 hours a month on manual follow-ups — amounting to 12 workdays a year lost to administrative "busy work."</li>
            <li><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> Data was scattered across various folders and email threads, making it impossible to get a real-time view of certification status.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Approach: From Large Teams to Solo Ownership</h2>
          <p>Transitioning from large-scale tech teams to a solo environment required a fundamental shift in my approach. Without a squad of PMs or engineers, I took full ownership of the entire lifecycle—from sitting down with the HR Director to map out their needs, to building the technical blueprints for how the system functions.</p>
          <p>I delivered a three-part platform designed to balance the compliance requirements with a seamless experience:</p>

          <h3>The Admin "Command Center"</h3>
          <p>I spent a lot of time on the Admin Dashboard to ensure it functioned as a true command center where the HR Director can see all employees at a glance, assign training, and track progress in real-time. It’s designed to handle the "heavy lifting" of technical architecture and compliance rules in the background so the front-end stays simple.</p>

          <h3>The Compliance Engine</h3>
          <p>To make the system "audit-proof," I built in automated guardrails that allow the system to essentially audit itself.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Enforced Viewing:</strong> I included mandatory minimum timers that prevent users from clicking through to the end, ensuring they meaningfully engage with the content.</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Verification:</strong> I made it easy for admins to build and add interactive quizzes to the end of any training to verify that staff actually absorbed the information.</li>
            <li><strong>Audit Defense:</strong> The system creates immutable, time-stamped acknowledgment records for every completed module, providing a solid defense in case of a state audit.</li>

          <p>Because this team is busy caring for seniors, they don't have time to struggle with a confusing interface. I focused on a "frictionless" design with high-accessibility standards (WCAG) and generous tap targets for use on any device.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear Visibility:</strong> Staff can instantly see their required quizzes and upcoming due dates.</li>

          <h3>The Result</h3>
          <p>By handling the technical architecture and compliance logic myself, I was able to ensure the system handles the boring stuff in the background. Everything is backed by automatic tracking—the second an employee finishes a quiz, the system updates their records instantly, removing the need for any manual data entry or human follow-up.</p>

          <h2>The Strategy</h2>
          <p>While I typically collaborate with engineers to bring a vision to life, this project required me to bridge that gap myself. By treating AI as a high-level technical partner, I moved beyond static designs to engineer a production-ready tool from the ground up.</p>

          <h3>Evolution of a New Workflow: "Vibe Coding"</h3>
          <p>To deliver on my goal of mastering AI-first development, I used a "Vibe Coding" workflow that matured as the complexity of the project grew:</p>          
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Learning the Patterns:</strong> I started with broad prompts, but quickly realized they led to fragile code that didn't meet my standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Guiding the Strategy:</strong> I shifted to using Gemini as a high-level logic partner—vetting my plans in plain English to ensure the technical architecture was sound before providing instructions to the building tool.</li>
            <li><strong>Driving the Execution:</strong> Toward the end, I was fully in the driver's seat. I developed a Governance Framework (a set of rules for privacy, accessibility, and engineering best practices) and moved from prompting to performing direct code edits for total control.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="eight offset-by-two columns">
          <h3>Building a People-First, Zero-Maintenance Solution</h3>
          <p>I didn't just want to build a tool; I wanted to build a sustainable system that could survive without a dedicated tech team. This required a focus on three core technical pillars:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Compliance Guardrails:</strong> I engineered technical "locks" like mandatory presentation timers, interactive quizzes, and immutable, time-stamped acknowledgments. This ensures the organization meets regulatory standards by default, removing the risk of human error.</li>
            <li><strong>Inclusive & Clear Design:</strong> Using WCAG accessibility standards and generous "tap targets" for mobile use, I made sure the interface was frictionless for staff who are busy caring for seniors and don't have time for a steep learning curve.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust, Zero-Cost Stack:</strong> To ensure long-term sustainability, I chose a professional-grade stack including Supabase (backend/database) and Google Auth (identity). This allows the platform to run with enterprise-level security and zero maintenance for $0/month.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>      

      <div class="row">
        <div class="eight offset-by-two columns divider_top">
          <h2>Estimated Success Metrics</h2>
          <p>We’re in the final steps before launch, and the projected impact is significant. Based on the previous manual workload of around 8 hours a month:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>70-80% Time Savings:</strong> By automating tracking and notifications, I eliminated the 8 hours a month previously spent on manual follow-ups, freeing up 12 workdays a year for high-impact strategic work.</li>
            <li><strong>100% Audit Accuracy:</strong> The system eliminates human error in data entry, ensuring every completion is accurately timestamped and recorded.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero-Cost Sustainability:</strong> By leveraging professional-grade free tiers, I managed to bypass the $2,400 annual cost of a typical commercial system. The result is a professional, sustainable tool that costs the non-profit $0/month to run.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>     

      <div class="row">
        <div class="eight offset-by-two columns divider_top">
          <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
          <p>This was my first experience with "Vibe Coding," and I’m honestly blown away by how quickly I could turn a vision into a fully functional tool. It was incredibly satisfying to take full ownership of the build, and I’m excited to keep using this workflow to bring more ideas to life.</p>
          <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Collaborative Workflow:</strong> I learned to communicate with the AI as a logic partner rather than just a task-runner. By moving beyond basic prompts and establishing clear standards, I could vet complex plans and maintain high quality throughout the build.</li>
            <li><strong>New Perspective on Engineering:</strong> I became much more familiar with how engineers structure data and best practices for building scalable software, which has improved how I communicate with technical teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Art of Balance:</strong> I learned to balance feature requests against time, costs, and complexity, ensuring the tool remains easy for the non-profit to manage in the future.</li>

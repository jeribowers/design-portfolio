          <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Flexport's customs brokerage operation relied on fragmented legacy workflows, with client requirements trapped in static documents. This forced brokers to manually cross-check every data point, resulting in a high "cost-to-serve" ($114 per entry) that made scaling for enterprise clients impossible.</p>
          <p><strong>The Action:</strong> As the Lead Designer, I spearheaded the 0→1 transition from manual checklists to an automation-first Task Manager. I designed a modular system that utilized LLMs for document digitization and prioritized tasks based on system confidence levels. To accelerate delivery, I developed a reusable component architecture that allowed engineers to deploy new task types without high-fidelity mocks for every iteration, drastically increasing velocity. I also led deep UAT and change management initiatives to build trust with a skeptical broker workforce, shifting their mindset from manual verification to "exception-based" oversight.</p>
          <p><strong>The Result:</strong> The transformation achieved a 50% reduction in cost-to-serve (dropping to $43 per entry) and a 20% efficiency gain in document transcription. By automating 25% of Importer Security Filings (ISF) and creating a scalable framework, we built the foundation to handle 80% of US entry volume through automation by 2025, turning a labor-heavy service into a high-margin product.</p>

          <h2>The Shift to Automation</h2>

          <h3>Business Objective</h3>
          <p><strong>Customs clearance is essential for global trade</strong>, ensuring goods move efficiently across borders while complying with import/export regulations. A customs import filing is the documentation required to legally bring goods into a country. Customs brokers handle product classification, duty calculation, and compliance to ensure smooth, penalty-free imports.</p>
          <p>At Flexport, our Customs brokers relied on an inefficient system that required multiple workarounds to prioritize and complete work. <strong>This lack of automation led to delays, increased costs, and operational bottlenecks.</strong> To scale and service more enterprise clients while reducing filing costs by 80%, we needed to completely rethink customs processing.</p>

          <h3>Defining the Vision</h3>
          <p>Recognizing the inefficiencies of the existing system, I took the lead in shifting from incremental improvements to an automation-first, task-based approach. While I set the strategic direction for this transformation, I worked closely with engineers, product managers, and business stakeholders to define priorities and ensure alignment with both technical feasibility and business objectives.</p>
          <h4>Key Challenges</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Importer-Specific Requirements</strong>: Client settings were scattered across Confluence, SOPs, and other tools, making automation difficult and leading to inconsistencies in service quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Trust Issues</strong>: Brokers frequently encountered incorrect or missing data in the core platform, requiring them to cross-check multiple sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Inefficient Workflows</strong>: Brokers had to navigate multiple tools and websites to complete filings, slowing processes and reducing efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Work Prioritization</strong>: Customs managers lacked tools to effectively assign and manage work, leading to wasted time as brokers manually sorted through a queue.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow System Performance</strong>: Delays in the core platform disrupted productivity, impacting entry filing completion and eroding trust with importers and brokers.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h2>Automating Customs Clearance with a Task-Based System</h2>
          <h3>From Milestones to Task-Based Automation</h3>
          <p>Initially, the system relied on milestones and checklists. However, after extensive research and stakeholder discussions, I determined that prioritizing automation and leveraging a task-based escalation system would be the most effective approach. This ensured brokers received the right information at the right time, streamlining workflows and improving efficiency.</p>

          <h3>Approach & Key Innovations</h3>
          <p>I established the guiding principles for the new Task Manager while collaborating with engineers, product managers, and business stakeholders to define priorities and introduce key innovations that drove efficiency.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Automation-First Approach</strong>: Continuous validation reduced manual entry and ensured accuracy by collecting structured data via EDI or API and standardizing inputs for automation. Manual intervention occurred only when system confidence was low.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Tasks Easy to Understand and Complete</strong>: The issue should be immediately clear, with all necessary information included to resolve the task efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritize Tasks by Urgency with Intelligent Task Routing</strong>: Tasks were dynamically assigned and prioritized, reducing bottlenecks.</li>
            <li><strong>Establish Feedback Loops</strong>: Continuously refine tasks to improve efficiency, with the goal of reducing or automating them over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement Business Rules</strong>: Tailor data rules to individual client needs, ensuring compliance and consistency across processes.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Driven Data Validation</strong>: Ensures compliance before submission, reducing errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial Invoice Digitization</strong>: Automates data extraction and processing using LLMs, minimizing manual input.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="eight offset-by-two columns">
          <h3>Defining UX Principles to Improve Trust and Ease of Use</h3>
          <p>Early in the project, I established trust and ease of use as the core user experience principles, ensuring the system provided accurate, reliable data while maintaining a simple and predictable workflow. To measure the effectiveness of feature changes, we used quantitative metrics, including time on task, task completion rate, task success rate, adoption rate, number of interactions and qualitative feedback.</p>

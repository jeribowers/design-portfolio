          <h3>Project at a Glance</h3>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Flexport's customs brokerage operation relied on fragmented workflows that were inefficient and required multiple workarounds to understand, assign, prioritize, and complete work. This forced brokers to manually cross-check every data point, resulting in a high &#34;cost-to-serve&#34; &#40;&#65284;114 per entry&#41; that made scaling for enterprise clients impossible.</p>
          <p><strong>The Action:</strong> As the Lead Designer, I spearheaded the 0 &rarr; 1 transition from a legacy platform to an automation-first approach. I designed a modular system that automated processes, utilized LLMs for document digitization, and automatically prioritized tasks based on system confidence levels. To accelerate delivery, I developed a reusable component architecture that allowed engineers to deploy new task types without high-fidelity mocks for every iteration, drastically increasing velocity. I also led deep UAT and change management initiatives to build trust with a skeptical broker workforce, shifting their mindset from manual verification to &ldquo;exception-based&rdquo; oversight.</p>
          <p><strong>The Result:</strong> The transformation achieved a 50&#37; reduction in cost-to-serve &#40;dropping to &#36;43 per entry&#41; and a 20&#37; efficiency gain in document transcription. By automating 25&#37; of Importer Security Filings &#40;ISF&#41; and creating a scalable framework, we built the foundation to handle 80&#37; of US entry volume through automation by 2025, turning a labor-heavy service into a high-margin product.</p>

          <h2>The Shift to Automation</h2>
          <h3>Business Objective</h3>
          <p>Customs clearance is a critical step in global trade, requiring accurate documentation to ensure goods move across borders compliantly and on time. At Flexport, customs brokers relied on a legacy system to manage, edit, and file import entries. The platform lacked automation and clear prioritization, forcing brokers to rely on manual workarounds to understand, verify, and submit filings.</p>
          <p>These inefficiencies led to delays, higher operational costs, and limited scalability. To support growth into enterprise customers and reduce filing costs by 80%, we needed to fundamentally redesign how customs processing worked which led the shift from a manual, broker-dependent workflow to a scalable, automated system.</p>

          <h3>Defining the Vision</h3>
          <p>Recognizing the inefficiencies of the system, I took the lead in transitioning from minor fixes of the existing platform to an automation-first, task-based approach. While I collaborated with two other designers on the initial high-level vision, I owned the end-to-end execution working cross-functionally with engineers and stakeholders to ensure our strategic direction aligned with both technical feasibility and business goals.</p>
          <h4>Key Challenges</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Importer-Specific Requirements</strong>: Client settings were scattered across Confluence, SOPs &#40;standard operating procedures&#41;, and other tools, making automation difficult and leading to inconsistencies in service quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Trust Issues</strong>: Brokers frequently encountered incorrect or missing data in the core platform, requiring them to cross-check multiple sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Inefficient Workflows</strong>: Brokers had to navigate multiple tools and websites to complete filings, slowing processes and reducing efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Work Prioritization</strong>: Customs managers lacked tools to effectively assign and manage work, leading to wasted time as brokers manually sorted through a queue.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow System Performance</strong>: Delays in the core platform disrupted productivity, impacting entry filing completion and eroding trust with importers and brokers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Automating Customs Clearance with a Task-Based System</h2>

          <h3>Approach &#38; Key Innovations</h3>
          <p>I established the guiding principles for the new Task Manager while collaborating with engineers, product managers, and business stakeholders to define priorities and introduce key innovations that drove efficiency.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Automation-First Approach</strong>: Continuous validation reduced manual entry and ensured accuracy by collecting structured data via EDI or API and standardizing inputs for automation. Manual intervention occurred only when system confidence was low.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Tasks Easy to Understand and Complete</strong>: The issue should be immediately clear, with all necessary information included to resolve the task efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritize Tasks by Urgency with Intelligent Task Routing</strong>: Tasks were dynamically assigned and prioritized, reducing bottlenecks.</li>
            <li><strong>Establish Feedback Loops</strong>: Continuously refine tasks to improve efficiency, with the goal of reducing or automating them over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement Business Rules</strong>: Tailor data rules to individual client needs, ensuring compliance and consistency across processes.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Driven Data Validation</strong>: Ensures compliance before submission, reducing errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial Invoice Digitization</strong>: Automates data extraction and processing using LLMs, minimizing manual input.</li>

            <li><strong>20&#37; efficiency increase</strong> in commercial document transcription.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Real-World Benefits</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduced Cost to Serve</strong>: Automated task routing significantly improves efficiency, minimizes manual workload, and directly reduces the cost to serve, our primary metric for evaluating operational improvements.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Supports 2K&#45;24K entries per year, enabling growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Compliance</strong>: AI-powered validation reduces errors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By defining the vision and execution strategy for automation while working cross-functionally to implement and refine it, I successfully delivered the Task Manager, significantly improving speed and accuracy for customs filings.</p>

          <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
          <p>The Task Manager transformed an outdated, manual-heavy process into an automated, efficient, and scalable system. By prioritizing UX, automation, and real-time insights, I created a platform that significantly improved cost-efficiency and user experience.</p>
          <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Navigating Complexity</strong>: Customs regulations are ambiguous and continuously evolving, requiring deep domain expertise to define problems accurately.</li>
            <li><strong>Balancing Design Quality &#38; Execution</strong>: As a 0 &rarr; 1 project, we had to prioritize releasing functional features to support scale over refining visual design and deeper ideation.</li>
            <li><strong>Managing Priorities as the Sole Designer</strong>: Juggling research, user testing, stakeholder management, design, and execution while meeting tight deadlines was a significant challenge.</li>

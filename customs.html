        <h2>Case Study: Transforming Customs Clearance with Automation</h2>
        <h4>Business Objective</h4>
        <p class="role"><span>My role:</span> %%% </p>
        <p><strong>Customs clearance is essential for global trade</strong>, ensuring goods move efficiently across borders while complying with import/export regulations. A customs import filing is the documentation required to legally bring goods into a country. Customs brokers handle product classification, duty calculation, and compliance to ensure smooth, penalty-free imports.</p>
        <p>At Flexport, our Customs brokers relied on an inefficient system that required multiple workarounds to prioritize and complete work. <strong>This lack of automation led to delays, increased costs, and operational bottlenecks.</strong> To scale and service more enterprise clients while reducing filing costs by 80%, we needed to completely rethink customs processing.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="eight offset-by-two columns">
        <h3>The Shift to Automation</h3>
        <p>Recognizing the inefficiencies of the existing system, I took the lead in shifting from incremental improvements to an automation-first, task-based approach. While I set the strategic direction for this transformation, I worked closely with engineers, product managers, and business stakeholders to define priorities and ensure alignment with both technical feasibility and business objectives.</p>
        <h4>Key Challenges</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Importer-Specific Requirements</strong> - Client settings were scattered across Confluence, SOPs, and other tools, making automation difficult and leading to inconsistencies in service quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Trust Issues</strong> - Brokers frequently encountered incorrect or missing data in the core platform, requiring them to cross-check multiple sources.</li>
          <li><strong>Inefficient Workflows</strong> - Brokers had to navigate multiple tools and websites to complete filings, slowing processes and reducing efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of Work Prioritization</strong> - Customs managers lacked tools to effectively assign and manage work, leading to wasted time as brokers manually sorted through a queue.</li>
          <li><strong>Slow System Performance</strong> - Delays in the core platform disrupted productivity, impacting entry filing completion and eroding trust with importers and brokers.</li>
        </ul>

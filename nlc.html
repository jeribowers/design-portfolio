        <h2>Case Study: Transforming Customs Clearance with Automation</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <h4>Business Objective</h4>
        <p class="role"><span>My role:</span> %%% </p>
        <p><strong>Customs clearance is essential for global trade</strong>, ensuring goods move efficiently across borders while complying with import/export regulations. A customs import filing is the documentation required to legally bring goods into a country. Customs brokers handle product classification, duty calculation, and compliance to ensure smooth, penalty-free imports.</p>
        <p>At Flexport, our Customs brokers relied on an inefficient system that required multiple workarounds to prioritize and complete work. <strong>This lack of automation led to delays, increased costs, and operational bottlenecks.</strong> To scale and service more enterprise clients while reducing filing costs by 80%, we needed to completely rethink customs processing.</p>

        <h3>The Shift to Automation</h3>
        <p>Recognizing the inefficiencies of the existing system, I took the lead in shifting from incremental improvements to an automation-first, task-based approach. While I set the strategic direction for this transformation, I worked closely with engineers, product managers, and business stakeholders to define priorities and ensure alignment with both technical feasibility and business objectives.</p>

      <div class="eight offset-by-two columns">
        <p>Two things that needed to be followed during the design process:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Align with the IBM Design Language</li>
          <li>Follow the WCAG and 508 accessibility requirements</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/language/">IBM Design Language</a> was launched in 2014. It included best practices, resources, and inspiration to help designers achieve a consistent visual language across their products that aligned with the IBM brand. In order to achieve this, getting continuous feedback from other designers was crucial. I was fortunate enough to sit next next to my design team, so I was able to get continual feedback on a daily basis. We also had weekly touchpoints with the development lead and offering manager to make sure we were aligned on requirements and priorities.</p>
        <p>Making software accessible to all users requires special considerations. For example, content that conveys meaning needs to follow the WCAG 2.0 level AA minimum requirements of a 4.5:1 contrast ratio. This includes items such as text, buttons, graphs, and tooltips. A couple online tools that I found useful were the <a href="https://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/color-contrast/index.php?">NSCU color palette accessibility evaluator</a> and the <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker">WebAIM color contrast checker</a>.</p>

      </figure>

      <div class="eight offset-by-two columns">
        <p>One issue we oftentimes ran into was not being able to use light colors for important information. It either lacked the necessary contrast ratio or the color already had implied meaning (think of red denoting an error). An upside we found when exploring dark UI’s was that it allowed greater freedom to use bright, saturated colors.</p>
        <h4>Hi-fidelity designs</h4>
        <p>I worked closely with the UX designer on my team to translate the existing wireframes into hi-fidelity designs. Each user flow would address a specific use case that the user would want to perform. For example, I  designed a flow for first-time use, adding content, searching, filtering, etc.</p>

      <div class="eight offset-by-two columns">
        <h4>User testing</h4>
        <p>Working closely with the UX designer and user researcher, we ran initial tests with proxy users in the studio. Sitting one-on-one with a designer, we tested interaction patterns, information architecture, microcopy, and gathered general feedback.</p>
        <p>Testing with users and getting continuous feedback allowed us to quickly improve the designs and make refinements.</p>
        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <p>During this time, we began developing a pattern library. (You can read about that next in the <a href="nlc-pattern-library.html">NLC pattern library</a> section.) Having the elements and patterns easily accessible, enabled me to quickly <a href="http://jeribowers.github.io/nlc/">prototype the tool</a> using the pattern library as a starting point. This was a valuable asset for the development team too as they began building the front-end. They were able to see the exact styles that were being applied to each element. This drastically cut-down on the need for red-lining documents or tedious back and forth communication between design and development.</p>

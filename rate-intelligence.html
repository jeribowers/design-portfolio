        <p class="role"><span>My role:</span> %%% </p>
        <p>RateIntelligence was a free rate shopping tool by Booking.com for partners (property owners) to help them predict their occupancy and maintain competitive prices. The tool enabled partners to gain insights into their local market, compare rates with their competitors, and set competitive rates by using market data to forecast trends.</p>
        <p>In 2018, we adjusted our strategy and set out to validate if a paid offering was desirable, viable, and feasible. My role was to lead the UX strategy and design for RateIntelligence and the new product, RateIntelligence PRO.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the partner</h2>
        <p>For the free version of RateIntelligence, we needed to better understand the mental model of partners and how they set their rates as part of their revenue strategy. We developed personas and journey maps based on partner research to empathize with our partners' needs and challenges.</p>
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>We put ourselves into the shoes of our partners and created empathy maps. Using the Jobs to Be Done framework (JTBD), we analyzed existing research to identify the key requirements that partners “hired” our product for. By the end of the session, we had identified 3 primary users: Owner Olivia, Reservation Manager Rebecca, and Revenue Manager Rick.</p>

        <h3>Journey mapping</h3>
        <p>I organized a 2-day workshop with the team to better understand the partner journey. The intended outcome was to have journey maps that visualized the primary use cases, actions, thoughts, feelings, and opportunities during each stage of their journey.</p>

          <h3>Project at a Glance</h3>
          <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Following a major reorganization, Booking.com's core product teams faced significant strategic fragmentation. Despite clear company-level goals, teams lacked a unified vision of the ideal guest experience, resulting in siloed execution and conflicting priorities across the ecosystem.</p>
          <p><strong>The Action:</strong> As the Lead of the UX Task-force, I assembled a cross-functional squad to translate abstract business goals into a tangible &#34;North Star.&#34; I designed and facilitated a multi-stage strategic framework: conducting stakeholder interviews with leadership, leading department-wide journey mapping workshops, and triangulating qualitative research with quantitative data. I moved the project from research to reality by creating high-fidelity user scenarios and concepts that demonstrated the future state. To ensure organizational buy-in, I launched a centralized internal resource and led a company-wide &#34;playback&#34; to socialize the vision.</p>
          <p><strong>The Result:</strong> The vision provided product leadership with a high-level benchmark for decision-making, ensuring roadmaps remained customer-centric while generating the excitement and alignment needed to move toward a cohesive long-term destination.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge: Strategic Fragmentation</h2>
          <p>In 2019, the department within Booking.com that was focused on accommodations and the guest experience, went through a reorganization and were in the process of redefining their strategy. A product organization without a vision, is like running a race and not knowing where the finish line is. There was general confusion regarding the priorities for each team, how they contributed to the overall company strategy, and why teams should collaborate with each other.</p>
          <p>The organization had already identified the purpose, current capabilities, and needed help defining the vision, which would inform the long-term strategy and execution.</p>

          <span class="badge badge-neutral">Milestone 1</span>
          <h2>Building the UX Task-force</h2>
          <p>To drive the vision forward, I spearheaded a UX Task-force of six Senior Designers, two UX Writers, and a Project Manager, with the Head of Strategy as our executive sponsor. This multidisciplinary team allowed us to transform abstract goals into a tangible, high-fidelity North Star for the organization. I kicked off the initiative with a strategic alignment session to define our core objectives, deliverables, and milestones, ensuring the team had the clarity and resources to execute effectively.</p>
          <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Scope Clarity:</strong> Defined "non-goals" early to prevent scope creep and manage stakeholder expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> By identifying potential blockers early, we maintained the agility to adjust course before they impacted our timeline.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Buy-in:</strong> I learned that securing product leadership buy-in isn't a one-time event; it requires a consistent "early and often" feedback loop to maintain momentum.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Velocity:</strong> Small, focused teams with clear time-boxing result in faster, more confident decision-making.</li>

          <h2>Synthesizing Stakeholder Priorities</h2>
          <p>I facilitated targeted discovery sessions with cross-functional product leaders to uncover high-level challenges and long-term ambitions. These conversations served a dual purpose: they provided the foundational insights needed to frame our strategic direction while simultaneously socializing the UX Task-force’s mission to ensure executive alignment from day one.</p>
          <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>From Research to Action:</strong> By converting interview notes into HMW and User Need statements, we ensured that every design decision in the ideation phase was backed by stakeholder data.</li>
            <li><strong>Upfront Alignment:</strong> Early collaboration with stakeholders eliminated downstream friction, ensuring our "ideal state" vision was pre-vetted against the organizational roadmap.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Uncovering the End-to-End Journey</h2>
          <p>To map the holistic guest experience, I empowered each task-force member to lead journey-mapping workshops within their respective product areas. By bringing together Product and UX leads, we captured a high-resolution view of user needs, friction points, and operational gaps. This collaborative approach allowed us to identify cross-functional opportunities that were previously hidden within product silos.</p>
          <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Inclusive Ownership:</strong> A product vision is only as effective as the team’s belief in it. By involving a diverse cross-section of the organization early on, we fostered a sense of shared ownership and ensured the vision was grounded in reality.</li>
            <li><strong>The Power of "How Might We":</strong> We used HMW statements to pivot from "fixing problems" to "unlocking opportunities." The phrasing was intentional: <strong>"How"</strong> signaled a commitment to exploration; <strong>"Might"</strong> embraced a plurality of solutions; and <strong>"We"</strong> reinforced that the journey toward the "ideal state" was a collective effort.</li>
            <li><strong>Shared Knowledge Base:</strong> I prioritized rigorous documentation, consolidating raw notes and workshop artifacts into a centralized user journey repository. This "single source of truth" ensured that no insight was lost and provided a durable reference for teams during the ideation phase.</li>

          <h2>Prioritization & Opportunity Mapping</h2>
          <p>After synthesizing the inputs from across the organization, the task-force moved from discovery to strategy. We needed to filter hundreds of raw insights into a high-impact themes. My goal was to ensure the vision wasn't just aspirational, but grounded in business logic and technical feasibility. I led the team through a rigorous prioritization framework.</p>
          <h3>Prioritization Criteria</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strategic Alignment (Scope):</strong> Does this move the needle on our North Star objectives?</li>
            <li><strong>User Value (Impact):</strong> Does this fundamentally resolve a primary guest pain point?</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation Velocity (Ease):</strong> What is the organizational appetite and technical readiness for this concept?</li>

          <p>To move beyond gut feel, I collaborated with data analysts and researchers to triangulate our qualitative findings with quantitative behavioral data.

            <li><strong>Hypothesis-Driven Data Science:</strong> I learned that to get the most out of our data partners, we had to provide clear hypotheses rather than broad questions. This structured communication accelerated our validation phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Inclusive Design:</strong> During "Big Idea" sessions, I observed that non-designers often felt intimidated by "ideation." I introduced visual templates and sketching frameworks that empowered all team members to contribute high-value concepts regardless of their drawing ability.</li>
            <li><strong>Removing Subjective Friction:</strong> By centralizing our logic in a transparent prioritization matrix, we eliminated "opinion-based" friction, allowing the task force to move quickly from abstract ideas to concrete solution sketches.</li>

          <h2>Narrating the Future State</h2>
          <p>To transform our data and concepts into an actionable vision, I led the task force in crafting a narrative-driven North Star. The objective was to move beyond feature-based thinking and instead visualize a seamless, end-to-end ecosystem. We developed three core user scenarios that served as "proof of concept" for the ideal future state, ensuring every design decision was anchored in real-world user needs.</p>
          <h3>Key Phases of the Guest Journey</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Discover & Decide:</strong> Visualizing how we solve the friction of group travel planning.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare & Travel</strong>: Demonstrating the power of proactive, high-utility features for high-intent users.</li>
            <li><strong>Reminisce</strong>: Highlighting the value of long-term loyalty and emotional connection beyond the transaction.</li>

          <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Semantic Precision:</strong> I collaborated closely with UX Copywriters to ensure our "User Needs" and "HMW" statements weren't just functional, but that they accurately captured the original intent.</li>
            <li><strong>Triangulating Insights:</strong> To build executive confidence, we didn't rely on a single source of truth. We merged qualitative feedback, quantitative behavior, and market trends to ensure our prioritized concepts were bulletproof.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Stakeholder Calibration:</strong> I maintained a tight feedback loop with leadership throughout the visualization process. These regular "calibration sessions" allowed us to pivot quickly if a concept drifted from the evolving organizational strategy, ensuring total alignment at the final playback.</li>

          <h2>Socializing the Vision & Organization Impact</h2>
          <p>To wrap up, we focused on making the vision an organizational standard rather than just a design project. I orchestrated a department-wide playback designed to spark imagination and ownership. Seeing the 'ideal state' visualized at scale didn't just align the teams – it inspired them. It bridged the gap between dry strategy and actual product work, giving everyone a shared destination to aim for and the creative confidence to get there.</p>
          <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Balancing Polish and Pace:</strong> Setting a firm playback date and internal milestones gave us a steady rhythm. It acted as a reality check that kept us from over-polishing the wrong details and forced us to focus on the stories that would actually move the needle.</li>
            <li><strong>Bridging the Gap:</strong> Visual storytelling is a great spark, but the real win was translation. Success meant getting insights into the hands of product squads in a way that felt actionable, giving them a clear path from today’s product to tomorrow’s ideal state.</li>            
            <li><strong>Creating a Living Resource:</strong> A vision is useless if it’s buried in a PDF. By building a "Vision Hub" (an internal site), we turned a one-time presentation into a durable, self-serve tool. This ensured teams could actually pull these assets into their own planning rather than seeing them once and forgetting.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
          <p>Creating the vision was just the starting line. The real win wasn't the final presentation — it was seeing the organization finally align on a single direction. By turning a "North Star" into something tangible, we moved the conversation from "what if?" to "what’s next," giving teams a shared foundation to build their own strategies upon.</p>
